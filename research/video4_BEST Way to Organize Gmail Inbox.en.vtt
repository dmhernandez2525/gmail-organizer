00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
Hey everyone, Michael here. Today, I want to&nbsp;
talk to you about how to organize Gmail and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.360
to inbox zero. When I worked at Google, I would&nbsp;
routinely receive 200 to 300 emails a day. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.000
let's be honest, no one can stay on top of that&nbsp;
amount of email. With this system, I'll ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.920
you never miss a follow-up and you'll always be&nbsp;
able to track your responses. Let's check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.400
When you look at your inbox, emails generally&nbsp;
fall into one of three categories. Follow-up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.540
awaiting response, and need to read. First, let's&nbsp;
go set up some labels. Here we are inside of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.420
inbox of Gmail. As you can see, I have a lot&nbsp;
of unread emails, and one of the first things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.520
I want to do is split these up into those three&nbsp;
categories we talked about, which are follow-up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.520
awaiting response, and to read. In order to do&nbsp;
that, I'm first going to need to create labels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
over here on the left side. I'm going to hit this&nbsp;
plus button to do so. The first label that I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.420
going to want to create here in the label prompt&nbsp;
is the label for follow-up. And one little trick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.160
that I like to do is I like to use the brackets on&nbsp;
my labels so that it ensures Gmail always keeps it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.900
at the top of the labels list, even if everything&nbsp;
becomes alphabetized. I'm going to go ahead and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.520
hit Create. I don't want to nest it under any&nbsp;
other labels, which means sort of bury it under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
another label. So this is the action I want to&nbsp;
take. Now that I've created the follow-up label,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.940
which we can see over here on the left side, I'm&nbsp;
going to want to follow-up on that follow-up label&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.400
by creating another one. Next, we're going to do&nbsp;
the awaiting response label, same thing as last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.700
time, hit the Create button. The final label&nbsp;
we're going to create is the one for to read,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.000
also create. Now that we've created our three&nbsp;
labels on the left here, we can see awaiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.920
response, follow-up, and to read. A nice touch&nbsp;
that I think really helps things stand out is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.440
to colorize them. And later when we set up&nbsp;
multiple inboxes, you'll see why this really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.200
helps. To colorize your labels, just move your&nbsp;
cursor directly to the right of them, click these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.140
three little dots, select in there, and hit Label&nbsp;
Color. For awaiting response, I personally always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.220
loved orange. For follow-up, I like yellow.&nbsp;
And for to read, since it's not that urgent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.780
I didn't like a really bright or hot color, I&nbsp;
just went with a light blue. Now that we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.120
our labels all set up and nicely colorized, let's&nbsp;
move over to the Settings section so we can add&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.660
something called Multiple Inboxes. Click the gear&nbsp;
icon to bring up all of the settings available in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.340
Gmail. What we're going to want to do now is&nbsp;
scroll past all of these settings you see here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.500
down to something called Multiple Inboxes. We're&nbsp;
going to click on this, and then we will also hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.620
Customize. Now that we've hit the Customization&nbsp;
button for multiple inbox sections, we are brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.240
to this beautiful area where we can decide to&nbsp;
break up the monolithic inbox of Gmail, which just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.820
goes on and on, into five distinct sections. So,&nbsp;
the first section we're going to create here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:10.020
the one about awaiting response. In order to name&nbsp;
one of our sections into awaiting response, we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.860
going to have to type in label colon, and then the&nbsp;
bracket Awaiting Response, and then end bracket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.020
It's important to use the exact characters we&nbsp;
use to make the label in order for Gmail to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.840
recognize that we want to use the label. Next,&nbsp;
we're going to want to enter in a friendly name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.980
We're going to repeat that step two more times,&nbsp;
once for follow-up and once for to read. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.020
that we have filled in all of the sections label&nbsp;
headings, we can move down and tinker with any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.820
the other settings we'd like to. Personally, I&nbsp;
do not want to change anything from the default&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.980
settings, but there is one that I do want to&nbsp;
change, which is the multiple inbox position. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.600
personally like to have that to the right of the&nbsp;
inbox because it is easier for me to process and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.100
look at. If you want to put it above the inbox&nbsp;
or below the inbox, that's completely up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.120
Next, and finally, we are going to hit save&nbsp;
changes to make sure that everything is kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.440
the way we want it. Now that we've saved&nbsp;
all of those settings for multiple inbox,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.900
we come back to the standard Gmail inbox and we&nbsp;
can notice some changes. Over here on the right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.100
we have our three buckets, awaiting response,&nbsp;
follow-up, and to read. This is really where we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.160
get to start using these buckets. So now you can&nbsp;
see over here, I have a whole inbox just waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.220
for me to read through and I want to chunk this&nbsp;
up nicely so I know what to do with them. So one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.200
of the first things that catches my eye is&nbsp;
this email about customer feedback received,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.100
and it says action required. So I'm going to&nbsp;
go ahead and right click on this and use label&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.180
as and put follow-up to it. And look at that,&nbsp;
it moves directly over into our bucket called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.980
follow-up. Now that we've moved Lee's email over&nbsp;
into follow-ups, I'm going to go back and check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.800
my inbox to see what else is in there that might&nbsp;
be worth looking at. I see here that there is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.520
internal newsletter. I've kind of been hearing&nbsp;
some buzz about this. I'm going to check on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.420
Okay, this looks like something that I&nbsp;
might want to read later. So I can also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.300
from this very screen, add a label and move it&nbsp;
to the to read section. Now that I've marked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.020
this one as to read, I'm going to go back&nbsp;
out to my inbox to see what else there is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.260
I see something from Lynne about&nbsp;
delivery not working as planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.520
Nope, this is Comic Sans. I'm not going to read&nbsp;
this one right now. It's too much too early in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.660
the morning, so I'm going to go back out. Then&nbsp;
there's this one where it says end of message. Can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.240
you work this weekend? Well, that's a bit cryptic,&nbsp;
so I'm going to actually reply to this. Now that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.140
I've followed up with Patti and asked her to&nbsp;
provide more context before I work this weekend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.720
I want to make sure that I have some idea as to&nbsp;
why she wants me to work this weekend, so I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.180
going to await her response. So, I'm going to go&nbsp;
up here to the label and hit Awaiting Response.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.860
Now you can see as we're back in the&nbsp;
general inbox area, we have three sections,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.200
each of which is filled up with email. So the&nbsp;
first one is Awaiting Response, which means I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.360
am just waiting for someone to get back to me and&nbsp;
I do not have any action required. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.940
there is one email in Follow Up, which means I&nbsp;
do have to do something and this really keeps me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.460
on track throughout the day that I have something&nbsp;
to do. Finally, I have one in the To Read bucket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.420
which ultimately could be considered the least&nbsp;
important bucket, but I do want to highlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.220
that there is something for me to read in the&nbsp;
future if I have the time to get to it. Now I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.560
going to go through and categorize the rest of my&nbsp;
messages in my inbox. Now that I've gone through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.960
and processed all my email and moved them into the&nbsp;
appropriate sections or buckets, I want to clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.020
out my inbox to get down to inbox zero. So what&nbsp;
I want to do now is go up here and say Select All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.740
and then find this little arrow archive button and&nbsp;
hit it. Now we have the most beautiful of sites,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.320
a complete inbox zero. This frees up our mental&nbsp;
space to deal with anything that we have left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:08.160
in the Follow Up section. Earlier today, I spoke&nbsp;
with Lynne offline and so I know we do not need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.300
to follow up with this Pigeon Delivery email&nbsp;
anymore, so I'm going to click the little X on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.700
this Follow Up label to get rid of it. After&nbsp;
removing the Follow Up label, I can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.280
it no longer exists in the Follow Up section&nbsp;
and it is also not in the Inbox section. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.880
that we've cleared out the inbox, I want to show&nbsp;
you a couple of other little tricks that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.460
do over here on the right-hand side. First, you&nbsp;
can expand and collapse these if they're ever too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.100
much for you to look at. If you want to prioritize&nbsp;
one type of email over another within a section,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.820
you can always use a little star icon. And if you&nbsp;
ever have too many emails that you feel you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.280
to read at once, you can go into a dedicated view&nbsp;
by clicking on these numbers. I know sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.380
Gmail can feel a bit daunting as one long list,&nbsp;
but I hope that this system has helped you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.000
control of your inbox a little more. If you&nbsp;
have any other tips or great ideas, please share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.920
them in the comments below and please do consider&nbsp;
subscribing and I will see you in the next video.
