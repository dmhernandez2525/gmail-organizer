In this video, I'm going to show you how to&nbsp;
clean up your Gmail inbox fast and easily. By&nbsp;&nbsp;
the end of this video, you'll be in possession&nbsp;
of a rare and valuable thing: the empty inbox,&nbsp;&nbsp;
with no mailing lists cluttering things up&nbsp;
and an easy way to keep your inbox clean in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the future. Now, I know that's promising a&nbsp;
lot, but we're going to make it happen all&nbsp;&nbsp;
in this video, so just make sure you&nbsp;
watch until the very end. Let's go!
So I'll show you two ways to clean up your&nbsp;
inbox: the quick and lazy 5-second way,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the smart way. Now, both work, but I'd stick&nbsp;
around for the smart way because you'll set it up&nbsp;&nbsp;
once and then your inbox will stay clean far&nbsp;
into the future. And now, for the quickest,&nbsp;&nbsp;
laziest way to clean your inbox, we'll just bulk&nbsp;
archive all of your emails at once. To do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;
check the box in the upper left to select all&nbsp;
emails on the page, and then click “select all&nbsp;&nbsp;
conversations” if that link appears. From here,&nbsp;
you can click the archive button to archive&nbsp;&nbsp;
everything at once. And if you archive all of your&nbsp;
emails, it'll empty out your inbox completely,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but you'll still be able to access all of your&nbsp;
mail in “All Mail” and search for them. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp;
the 5-second solution, and you could do that,&nbsp;
but I don't really recommend this because it&nbsp;&nbsp;
just sweeps the mess under the rug and you&nbsp;
might still need to deal with some of these&nbsp;&nbsp;
emails still. Also, it'll just fill right back up&nbsp;
again, and you'll have to keep clearing it out.
So now I'm going to show you the five-step process&nbsp;
to clean up your inbox the right way. One thing&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can do to make an immediate impact on your&nbsp;
inbox without archiving or deleting anything&nbsp;&nbsp;
is to open up “Settings,” “See All Settings,”&nbsp;
and then open “Inbox” and then check the box to&nbsp;&nbsp;
turn on the “Updates” category and then click&nbsp;
“Save Changes.” When you do this, you'll see&nbsp;&nbsp;
that your inbox is a lot smaller now, and now&nbsp;
we have this new “Updates” category here. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is going to pull in some newsletters&nbsp;
as well as receipts and transaction notices&nbsp;&nbsp;
you might receive. Basically, anything&nbsp;
that's a notification or update email&nbsp;&nbsp;
is going to now get pulled into here&nbsp;
instead of cluttering up your inbox,&nbsp;&nbsp;
so it cleans things up quite a bit. Having&nbsp;
updates turned on helps, but there are probably&nbsp;&nbsp;
a lot of mailing list emails still cluttering&nbsp;
up your inbox. We'll take care of those next.
The first thing we'll do is search for the word&nbsp;
"unsubscribe." This will pull up every email in&nbsp;&nbsp;
your account with an unsubscribe link in&nbsp;
it. Most mailing lists provide a link so&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can unsubscribe, so this will instantly&nbsp;
give us all of those emails. Pretty clever,&nbsp;&nbsp;
right? Then from here, click “Advanced Search,”&nbsp;
“Create Filter.” Now we can decide what to do&nbsp;&nbsp;
with all of these emails, both already in your&nbsp;
inbox and ones you might be receiving in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
future. So what we'll do is we'll have them skip&nbsp;
the inbox, and then we'll check “Apply the Label,”&nbsp;&nbsp;
click “Choose Label,” click “New Label,” and&nbsp;
then type “Subscriptions” for the label name,&nbsp;&nbsp;
then click “Create.” Now, very important, we&nbsp;
want to make sure we check “Also Apply Filter&nbsp;&nbsp;
to Matching Conversations,” so it'll archive and&nbsp;
label all of the subscriptions we already have in&nbsp;&nbsp;
our inbox, and then click “Create Filter.” Now&nbsp;
on the left, you'll see a folder with all the&nbsp;&nbsp;
subscriptions you have. Now, if you have a lot&nbsp;
of subscriptions, it might take a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your inbox should be significantly smaller, and&nbsp;
now even better, all of your subscriptions will&nbsp;&nbsp;
automatically skip your inbox and show up here&nbsp;
under “Subscriptions” from now on. How many emails&nbsp;&nbsp;
do you have in your subscriptions folder? Leave a&nbsp;
comment below and let us know just how bad it was.
Now, whatever's left in here, we can thin&nbsp;
this out even more if there are emails&nbsp;&nbsp;
we don't want to see in here. First of all,&nbsp;
if you want to mute specific email threads,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can always right-click on any conversation&nbsp;
and click "Mute." This will cause those emails&nbsp;&nbsp;
to stop showing up in your inbox, and they'll&nbsp;
be archived automatically, and it just affects&nbsp;&nbsp;
the one email thread at a time, not emails with&nbsp;
other subject lines from the same sender. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you want to hide all emails from any&nbsp;
particular address, just right-click any&nbsp;&nbsp;
email from the sender and click "Find Emails from&nbsp;
that Sender," and then you can click “Advanced&nbsp;&nbsp;
Search,” “Create Filter,” and from here you&nbsp;
can decide whether it should skip the inbox,&nbsp;&nbsp;
get a label, or just be deleted. So if you need&nbsp;
to set up some additional filters to take care&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the recurring emails that weren't&nbsp;
pulled into updates or subscriptions,&nbsp;&nbsp;
now at this point whatever is in your inbox should&nbsp;
be mostly things that are pretty important to you.
So to take care of what's left in your inbox&nbsp;
we're going to set up just two additional&nbsp;&nbsp;
folders. First, we'll click the plus next to&nbsp;
"Labels" and create a label called “To-Do,” then&nbsp;&nbsp;
create another label called “Saved for Later.”&nbsp;
How this works now is everything that requires&nbsp;&nbsp;
you to take some sort of action or you need to&nbsp;
respond, just drag those emails to the "To-Do"&nbsp;&nbsp;
folder so they don't get lost in the clutter, and&nbsp;
now you'll be able to see exactly how many things&nbsp;&nbsp;
you need to take action on at any given time.&nbsp;
It becomes like a to-do list for yourself right&nbsp;&nbsp;
within your email. Now for everything else, we'll&nbsp;
just assume it's old email you want to hang on to,&nbsp;&nbsp;
so we're going to select all emails, select&nbsp;
all conversations, and then drag them right&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the “Saved for Later” folder. Now, in the&nbsp;
future, any emails that you want to hang on to&nbsp;&nbsp;
and not get lost in your archive in “All Mail,”&nbsp;
we're going to stash those emails in “Saved for&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later” to indicate that you've reviewed them&nbsp;
and processed them and don't need to see them&nbsp;&nbsp;
anymore. And boom! Just like that, we are now at&nbsp;
inbox zero. Congratulations on taming the beast!
By the way, if you're getting value out of&nbsp;
this video, hit like, subscribe, and tap the&nbsp;&nbsp;
notification icon to get more valuable content&nbsp;
like this. Of course, we've only dealt with the&nbsp;&nbsp;
immediate problem of decluttering your inbox,&nbsp;
but more emails will be coming in at some point,&nbsp;&nbsp;
hopefully far less now that we set some filters&nbsp;
up, but you'll need a strategy to deal with the&nbsp;&nbsp;
new ones that come in. It's a simple three-step&nbsp;
process. When you check your email from now on:&nbsp;&nbsp;
step one, anything you need to take action on&nbsp;
immediately goes in your “To-Do” folder. Step two,&nbsp;&nbsp;
anything you don't want to keep, you&nbsp;
just remove it immediately—delete it,&nbsp;&nbsp;
mute it, or set up a filter to ignore that&nbsp;
sender. Step three, everything you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;
save gets taken out of your inbox and put&nbsp;
right into the “Saved for Later” folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and that way you can still get to it quickly, but&nbsp;
it won't get lost among your subscriptions and&nbsp;&nbsp;
updates in the archive. That's it, just three&nbsp;
steps when you check your email from now on:&nbsp;&nbsp;
to-do, remove, and save for later. This is&nbsp;
going to keep your inbox empty from now on.
Now, if you want to stop here, you can,&nbsp;
but wouldn't it be nice if subscriptions&nbsp;&nbsp;
had stuff you actually cared about in&nbsp;
it? So we can open up subscriptions&nbsp;&nbsp;
and anything you don't want to keep, just use&nbsp;
the unsubscribe button that Gmail shows you,&nbsp;&nbsp;
or open the email itself and find the&nbsp;
unsubscribe link. Then you'll right-click&nbsp;&nbsp;
the email and choose "Find Emails from the&nbsp;
Sender," then select all emails on the page,&nbsp;&nbsp;
select all conversations if that link shows up,&nbsp;
and you can either delete them or report spam if&nbsp;&nbsp;
you never signed up for them to begin with. Just&nbsp;
unsubscribe from as many as you want at a time&nbsp;&nbsp;
until you get rid of all the ones you don't&nbsp;
want. That's how you keep your inbox clean.
Now, if you want to do any of these steps&nbsp;
on your phone, it is possible to do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but you'll need to open up the desktop version&nbsp;
of Gmail on your phone. There's a link below for&nbsp;&nbsp;
how to do that. So now you've tamed the beast, and&nbsp;
you've reached inbox zero, and that's a huge deal,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but there are still a few things you can do&nbsp;
from here that will unlock new abilities in&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gmail that you didn't even know were possible.&nbsp;
I've got some of the hottest tips for Gmail,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and you'll definitely want to check those out in&nbsp;
this video right here. I hope you've learned a few&nbsp;&nbsp;
things. Again, let us know in the comments below&nbsp;
just how many emails you started with. It's kind&nbsp;&nbsp;
of fun to see how bad it can get. Thanks for&nbsp;
watching, and I'll see you in this next video.
